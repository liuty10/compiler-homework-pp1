I have implemented all the rules, including HEX numbers and MACROS and some strange symbols that are not required for this homeowrk.

DO NOT USE MAKEFILE TO COMPILE TO PROJECT.

USE build.sh and exec.sh to build and run the project.
Example:

cd workdir
./build.sh

Then,
./exec.sh ../sample/badbool.frag
